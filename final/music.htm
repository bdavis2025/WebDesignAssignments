			<h1>'Twas the Night Before Christmas</h1>
			
			<p>
			'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
			Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
			The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
			In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br />
			The children were nestled all snug in their beds;<br />
			While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
			And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
			Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br />
			When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
			I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br />
			Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
			Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br />
			The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br />
			Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,<br />
			When what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br />
			But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,<br />
			With a little old driver so lively and quick,<br />
			I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.<br />
			More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />
			And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br />
			"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!<br />
			On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!<br />
			To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br />
			Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br />
			As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />
			When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br />
			So up to the housetop the coursers they flew<br />
			With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too<br />
			And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />
			The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />
			As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
			Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br />
			He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />
			And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br />
			A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br />
			And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.<br />
			His eyes--how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br />
			His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />
			His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />
			And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;<br />
			The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />
			And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;<br />
			He had a broad face and a little round belly<br />
			That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br />
			He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />
			And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br />
			A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br />
			Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br />
			He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />
			And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br />
			And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
			And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br />
			He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
			And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br />
			But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight<br />
			"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</p>
